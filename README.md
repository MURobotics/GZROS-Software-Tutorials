# MU Robotics Software Tutorial 1: Setting Up

### Preface
This tutorial will walk you through the process to setup the development environment that we will use within our other tutorials.

### Hardware/Software Requirements?
Currently, these methods should be supported on Windows, Mac and Ubuntu to varying degrees of ease to implement.

In consideration to processor architecture, while x86 is the expected processor architecture, accommodations can be made to support arm-based processors if needed.

For minimum system requirements, it is encouraged that you have 2 cores and 4GB of RAM. It is additionally encouraged that your system has a form of GPU to assist in removing the burden of rendering the simulation. While there is a chance that these tutorials can work with any system not fulfilling these requirements, we expect the minimum viable performance to be at this level.

## Method 1 (recommended for Windows and Mac): Using a Virtual Machine

This method will have us walk through the process of setting up a virtual machine which has Ubuntu installed along with the core software required for these tutorials, in addition to other robotics components you can work with in the future. While we will be walking through a Virtual Box configuration, you're able to use any virtual machine management software that you're comfortable with.

### Step 1: Installing Virtual Box
With our tutorials we hope to fulfill several goals to ensure our tutorials can maintain a sufficient level of quality and engagement with those who are willing to learn, this includes:

## Method 2: Using Docker Natively
Throughout these tutorials we'll be developing and testing using these technologies:

### Step 2:

## Bonus Method (Requires Ubuntu OS): Installing Packages Manually

## Report a Bug
If you are experiencing technical difficulties throughout these courses, you may report these on our repository [issues page](https://github.com/MURobotics/GZROS-Software-Tutorials/issues). We'll attempt to keep an active eye on issues that are presented and help provide some guidance to these issues, we want to actively encourage the reporting of issues to better improve the learning experience for everyone. Additionally, if you have any questions regarding the completion of these tutorials, be sure to ask fellow MU Robotic members for any questions or help.

## Next Steps
To continue with the series of tutorials, be sure to select a new branch to change your lesson. Our next section will begin to show how Robot Operating System (ROS) can interact with Gazebo and be used to program movement for a robot. Here is a link to our [tutorials](https://github.com/MURobotics/GZROS-Software-Tutorials/branches/all).
