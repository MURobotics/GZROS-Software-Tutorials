# MU Robotics Software Tutorial 1: Setting Up

### Preface
This is a repository made by MU Robotics that's dedicated to educating people on the software development aspect of robotics that's seen within higher level devices. These topics will include robotic **movements, sensing, navigation and more** with an introduction and tutorial to each section within the branch documentation.

## Step 1: Create The Environment

### Method 1 (recommended): Using a Virtual Machine
With our tutorials we hope to fulfill several goals to ensure our tutorials can maintain a sufficient level of quality and engagement with those who are willing to learn, this includes:

####

### Method 2: Using Docker Natively
Throughout these tutorials we'll be developing and testing using these technologies:

## Report a Bug
If you are experiencing technical difficulties throughout these courses, you may report these on our repository [issues page](https://github.com/MURobotics/GZROS-Software-Tutorials/issues). We'll attempt to keep an active eye on issues that are presented and help provide some guidence to these issues, we want to actively encourge the reporting of issues to better improve the learning experience for everyone. Additionally, if you have any questions regarding the completion of these tutorials, be sure to ask fellow MU Robotic members for any questions or help.

## Next Steps
To continue with the series of tutorials, be sure to select a new branch to change your lesson. Our next section will begin to show how Robot Operating System (ROS) can interact with Gazebo and be used to program movement for a robot. Here is a link to our [tutorials](https://github.com/MURobotics/GZROS-Software-Tutorials/branches/all).
